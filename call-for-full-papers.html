                            <p>The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval (IR). The 43rd ACM SIGIR conference, to be held in Xi'an, China, welcomes contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including theories and foundations, algorithms and applications, and evaluation and analysis. The conference and program chairs invite those working in areas related to IR to submit high-impact original papers for review.</p>

                            <p>Submissions of full research papers must be in English, in PDF format, and be at most 9 pages (including figures) + 1 pages of references in length, in the current ACM two-column conference format. Suitable LaTeX, Word, and

Full research papers must describe work that is not previously published, not accepted for publication elsewhere, and not currently under review elsewhere (including as a short-paper submission for SIGIR 2020). Submissions must be anonymous and should be submitted electronically via the

                                Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission. The submissions document must not include author information and must not include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent. Note however, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions. For example, instead of stating that an experiment “was conducted on the logs of a major search engine”, the authors should refer to the search engine by name. The reviewers will be informed that it does not necessarily imply that the authors are currently affiliated with the mentioned organization. While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places anonymity at risk (which could result in a negative outcome of the reviewing process). Authors should carefully go through ACM’s authorship policy before submitting a paper. To support identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author list must be specified at submission time. Authors should note that changes to the author list after the submission deadline are not allowed without permission from the PC Chairs. At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend, and present the work at the conference.
