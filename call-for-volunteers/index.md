We are seeking volunteers for the 43rd Annual ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval (SIGIR 2020), which will be held as a virtual conference during July 25-30, 2020.

Volunteers will participate in the organization of the conference. As SIGIR 2020 will be held as a virtual conference for the first time, we do need your help.

The responsibility of the volunteers includes:
* Attend a training session for volunteers before the conference
* Coordinate the online meetings for keynote speeches, full paper sessions, online social events, and virtual discussion sessions
* Contact the speakers and presenters and help them test the online meeting system before the meeting
* Download and review the recorded presentation video; and play it on behalf of the presenter if he/she cannot, or chooses not to, perform a live presentation  

The benefits of being a volunteer includes:
* **FREE** access to tutorials, workshops, and main conference of SIGIR 2020 (A full reimbursement will be given if he/she has already registered for the conference)
* Get to know and work with other volunteers:)
