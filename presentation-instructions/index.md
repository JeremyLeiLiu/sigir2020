# {{ page.title }}

This year, organizing paper presentation at SIGIR conference is much challenging due to three reasons: 

(1) SIGIR 2020 will be a fully online conference and it causes many potential problems for paper presentation (e.g. lack of interaction, unreliable network connection, etc.). To avoid these potential problems, we have to ask for extra materials (e.g. pre-recorded videos, meta information) from authors to construct a Web-based conference portal. 

(2) We have to accommodate the largest number of accepted papers in SIGIR history. This year SIGIR received more submissions than any previous year and accepted a record high number of 147 full papers and 153 short papers. To avoid too many parallel sessions, we have to arrange paper presentation at some non-working hours. 

(3) We have to develop a conference program which is convenient for our community members all around the world. It not only means that paper authors should present their works at a comfortable time, but also indicates that participants should enjoy all conference events conveniently. The conference schedule therefore lasts almost 24 hours per day during the main conference. 

To meet these challenges, we design different forms of presentation for different kinds of papers. Please refer to the following category for your presentation type(s).

<hr>
## FULL PAPER 

Each full paper should be presented by an author (presenter). The presenter should prepare a 20-min video which will be presented at the conference Web portal during the conference period. The video as well as other paper information should be submitted via http://xxx/ before July XX, 2020.

The presenter is also expected to give a live talk (15min + 5min QA) using Zoom at the corresponding full paper session (http://xxx/). In case of emergent network problem during the live talk, the volunteer at the paper session can play the video for the paper. However, most presenters should give the talk in person instead of using a video. 

Each full paper can apply for a time slot of virtual discussion room usage for further discussions. Details can be found at the VIRTUAL DISCUSSION ROOM part. 

<hr>
## SHORT PAPER 

The authors of each short paper should prepare a 10-min video which will be presented at the conference Web portal during the conference period. The video as well as other paper information should be submitted via http://xxx/ before July XX, 2020. 

The authors are also expected to interact with the participants via the online discussion forum on the Web portal during the corresponding short paper session (http://xxx/). 

Each short paper can apply for a time slot of virtual discussion room usage for further discussions. Details can be found at the VIRTUAL DISCUSSION ROOM part.

## VIRTUAL DISCUSSION ROOM 

To increase the interaction between participants, we set up a number of TEN virtual discussion rooms which can hold up to 200 people each. Each full, short, TOIS, industry track and demo paper can apply for a time slot to use the virtual rooms. Each time slot is half an hour and will be coordinated by the applicant with the help from a volunteer. The time slot information for the paper will also be updated on the Web portal so that participants can choose their interested
discussions to attend. 

The available time slots for discussion rooms are as follows (all the following time are GMT+8):
