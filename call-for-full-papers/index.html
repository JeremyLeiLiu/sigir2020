                        <p>The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the presentation of new
                            research results, and the demonstration of new systems and techniques, in the broad field of
                            information retrieval (IR). The 43rd ACM SIGIR conference, to be held in Xi'an, China,
                            welcomes contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access, including
                            theories and foundations, algorithms and applications, and evaluation and analysis. The
                            conference and program chairs invite those working in areas related to IR to submit
                            high-impact original papers for review.</p>

                        <p>
                            Authors are required to take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their
                            submission. The submissions document must not include author information and must not
                            include citations or discussion of related work that would make the authorship apparent.
                            Note however, that it is acceptable to explicitly refer in the paper to the companies or
                            organizations that provided datasets, hosted experiments, or deployed solutions. For
                            example, instead of stating that an experiment “was conducted on the logs of a major search
                            engine”, the authors should refer to the search engine by name. The reviewers will be
                            informed that it does not necessarily imply that the authors are currently affiliated with
                            the mentioned organization. While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint
                            repositories such as arXiv.org before reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this
                            since it places anonymity at risk (which could result in a negative outcome of the reviewing
                            process). Authors should carefully go through <a
                                href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/authorship">ACM’s authorship policy</a>
                            before submitting a
                            paper. To support identification of reviewers with conflicts of interest, the full author
                            list must be specified at submission time. Authors should note that changes to the author
                            list after the submission deadline are not allowed without permission from the PC Chairs. At
                            least one author of each accepted paper is required to register for, attend, and present the
                            work at the conference.
