                        <p>
                            SIGIR is the major international forum for the presentation of new research results and for
                            the demonstration of new systems and techniques in the broad field of information retrieval
                            (IR). Proposals are solicited for workshops to be held at ACM SIGIR 2020 in Xi’an, China.
                            Workshops are either set up as half-day or full-day workshops and will be held on Thursday
                            30th July 2020.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="margin-bottom-5"><strong>Topics of Interests</strong></h2>
                        <p>
                            SIGIR 2020 workshops will provide a platform for presenting novel ideas and emerging areas
                            in IR, in a less formal and more focused way than the conference itself. Workshop topics
                            typically match those identified in the SIGIR 2020 general call for contributions, but
                            proposals concerned with other areas of IR are welcome as well. <strong> We encourage prospective
                            workshop organizers to submit proposals for highly interactive workshops (either full-day or
                            half-day) focusing on either in-depth analysis or broad-ranging approaches to information
                            retrieval. </strong> The format of each workshop is to be determined by the organizers. We expect
                            workshops to contain ample time for discussion and engagement of all participants – not just
                            those presenting papers. Workshops that foster collaboration, discussion, group
                            problem-solving and community building initiatives are particularly encouraged. Workshops
                            that only revolve around the presentation of papers in a “mini conference” format are
                            discouraged.
                        </p>
                        <p>Researchers and practitioners from all areas of IR are invited to submit proposals for
                            review. The organizers of approved workshops will be expected to define the workshop’s
                            focus, gather and review submissions, and decide upon the final program content. Organizers
                            (including co-organizers) are encouraged to write an article for the ACM SIGIR Forum
                            summarizing the event. At least two organizers are expected to attend the entire workshop.
