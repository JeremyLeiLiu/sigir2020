                            <h2><strong>ACM SIGIR 2020 Registration Guidelines</strong></h2>
                       
                       <p>Registration for SIGIR 2020 is now open!</p>                      
                       <p>Instead of being held as an on-site conference from July 25 to 30 in Xiâ€™an, China, the prescheduled host city, SIGIR 2020 would be a virtual conference with the same schedule. To provide our attendees with a rememberable conference this year, in coordination with of the sponsors and partners, the organizers of SIGIR 2020 have been making all their efforts in transforming the conference into an online format. Detailed schedule would be available once everything is ready. The organizers of SIGIR 2020 are awareness of the fact that people in our community are experiencing difficulties during the pandemic of COVID-19 as well. As a response, the attendees are provided with highly reduced registration fees this year. There are 6 registration types with different registration rates:</p>
                       <ul>
                           <li>Author - Main Conference</li>
                           <li>Author - Tutorials and Workshop</li>
                           <li>Non-student premium attendee</li>
                           <li>Student premium attendee</li>
                           <li>Organizer</li>
                           <li>Volunteer</li>
                       </ul>
                       
                       <p>Despite of the number of authors in the accepted full papers, short papers, demo papers and industry track papers, only ONE author of EACH accepted paper ought to register as Author-Main Conference. This is a flat registration fee and no student discount can apply.</p>
                       <p>Despite of the number of authors in the accepted workshop papers, only ONE author of EACH accepted paper ought to register as Author-Tutorials and Workshops. This is a flat registration fee and no student discount can apply.</p>
                       <p>Please register as an author if there is only one author of your accepted paper who will attend the conference. The rest of the attendees who are willing to attend the conference are invited to register as either a Non-student premium attendee or a Student premium attendee and enjoy the premium services we provide. There are discounts for early bird registration and we highly encourage attendees to register earlier to have a lower price. In addition, if you go with the Passport, which includes both Main Conference and Tutorials + Workshops, the registration fee would be much cheaper.</p>
                       <p>As was committed by the organizing committee when biding for hosting SIGIR 2020, the students who register as the Student premium attendee enjoy a record low price for registration to SIGIR 2020. Students with EARLY registration (until June 30, 2020) only spend $45 to have a Passport attending both the main conference and tutorials + workshops. For organizers and/or volunteers of SIGIR 2020, please register as Organizer or Volunteer in the registration system. Details for registration fees are listed below.</p>
