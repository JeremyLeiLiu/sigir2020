                        <p>
                            The annual SIGIR conference is the major international forum for the
                            presentation of new research results, and the demonstration of new
                            systems and techniques, in the broad field of information retrieval
                            (IR). The 43rd ACM SIGIR conference, to be held in Xi'an, China, welcomes
                            contributions related to any aspect of information retrieval and access,
                            including theories and foundations, algorithms and applications, and
                            evaluation and analysis.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The conference and short paper program chairs invite those working in
                            areas related to IR to submit <strong>original (four-page) short papers</strong>, which
                            will be presented as posters at the conference. Short papers present
                            original, previously unpublished work that make a novel research
                            contribution to the field. They provide an opportunity to describe
                            significant work in progress or research that is best communicated in an
                            interactive or graphical format. Compared to full papers, their
                            contribution may be narrower in scope, be applied to a narrower set of
                            application domains, or have weaker empirical support than that expected
                            for a full paper. Submissions likely to generate discussions in new and
                            emerging areas are especially encouraged. We welcome submissions in all
                            areas related to any aspect of IR, as identified in the call for full
                            papers on the conference website
                            (<a

                            and repeated in the list below.
                        </p>

                        <p>Submissions will be peer reviewed, and accepted submissions will be
                            published in the conference proceedings. At least one author for each
                            accepted submission is required to register for the conference by the
                            early registration deadline. Furthermore, an author must be present at
                            the conference to present the work as a poster during the poster
                            session, where researchers can obtain direct feedback about their work
                            from a wide audience. Accepted submissions where authors fail to
                            register by the early deadline or cannot attend to present are subject
                            to being withdrawn from the conference proceedings at the discretion of
                            the chairs.&nbsp;A Best Short Paper Award will be awarded; nominations will
                            be decided based on reviewer assessments on the submitted version with
                            the Awards committee making the final decision among the nominees based
                            on review of the camera-ready version.

                        <h3>Submission Guidelines</h3>

                        <p>All papers must be original works by the authors, previously
                            unpublished, and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or
                            conference. Submissions of short papers must be in English, in PDF
                            format, and should not exceed four (4) pages in the current ACM
                            two-column conference format (including references and figures).
                            Suitable LaTeX and Word templates are available from the <a
                                href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM
                                Website</a>.
                            Short papers must describe work that is not previously published, not
                            accepted for publication elsewhere, and not currently under review
                            elsewhere. Submissions should not contain any author identification and
                            should be submitted electronically via the <a
                                href="https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigir2020">conference submission

                            The short-paper review process is double-blind. Authors are required to
                            take all reasonable steps to preserve the anonymity of their submission.
                            While authors can upload to institutional or other preprint repositories
                            such as
                            <a href="http://arxiv.org/">arXiv.org</a>&nbsp;before
                            reviewing is complete, we generally discourage this since it places
                            anonymity at risk (which could result in a negative outcome of the
                            reviewing process). Submissions which violate the pre-print policy,
                            anonymity, length, or formatting requirements or are plagiarized are
                            subject to desk-rejection by the chairs. Authors should carefully go
                            through <a href="https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/authorship">ACM’s authorship
                                policy</a>&nbsp;before
                            submitting a paper. Authors should note that changes to the author list
                            after the submission deadline are <strong>not allowed&nbsp;without</strong> permission from
                            the PC Chairs.&nbsp; At least one author of each accepted paper is
                            <strong>required</strong> to register for, attend, and present the work at the conference.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            All short papers are to be submitted via EasyChair at
